# node-server
This project is my first nodejs project and in this project
- I learned how to use Git and Heroku with Visual studio Code
- I learned how to deploy a project
- I learned about asynchronous calls used in NodeJs after I was using synchronous calls in Laravel(php)
- I used APIs to get place coordinates and pass these coordinates to other api to get other informations about that place
